    "# FINE-TUNING A MODEL FOR FUNCTION-CALLING\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple example, **we're going to fine-tune an LLM for function calling.**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is part of the <a href=\"https://www.hf.co/learn/agents-course\">Hugging Face Agents Course</a>, a free Course from beginner to expert, where you learn to build Agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/agents-course/course-images/resolve/main/en/communication/share.png\" alt=\"Agent Course\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Function-calling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Function-calling is a process in which we provide an LLM with tools and allow it to determine the parameters with which it should call those tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "I would separate function-calling from a regular agent because function-calling is something the agent has been explicitly trained to do, relying less on prompting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function-calling is typically a type of JSON agent that has been fine-tuned to follow instructions and invoke tools when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike standard JSON agents, function-calling models have a new set of special tokens used to further delimit conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, Mistral models have introduced new tokens to handle tools natively:\n",
    "- `[AVAILABLE_TOOLS]` – Start the list of available tools  \n",
    "- `[/AVAILABLE_TOOLS]` – End the list of available tools  \n",
    "- `[TOOL_CALLS]` – Make a call to a tool (i.e., take an \"Action\")  \n",
    "- `[TOOL_RESULTS]` – \"Observe\" the result of the action  \n",
    "- `[/TOOL_RESULTS]` – End of the observation (i.e., the model can decode again)  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "If a normal JSON agent primarily operates through **prompting**, a function-calling agent relies on **training** to invoke tools effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How do we train our model for function-calling ?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Answer : The necessicity for this is **data**\n",
    "\n",
    "A model training can be seen in 3 steps :\n",
    "- 1) The model is pretrained on a large quantity of data. The output of that step is a pre-trained model.\n",
    "- 2) The model can be **fine-tuned** on instruction following either by the model creator or by an individual ( or both ).\n",
    "- 3) The model can be **aligned** to the creator's preference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Usually a full fledged product like Gemini has been through all 3 steps while the models you can find on Hugging Face have passed by one or more steps of this training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will build a function-calling model based on **\"google/gemma-2-2b-it\"**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The base model is \"google/gemma-2-2b\". The google team then fine-tuned the base model on instruction following : resulting in **\"google/gemma-2-2b-it\"**. In this case we will take **\"google/gemma-2-2b-it\"** as base and not the base model because the prior fine-tuning it has been through is important for our use-case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we want to interract with our model through conversations in messages, starting from the base model would requiere more training in order to learn instruction following and chat format, **as well as** function-calling.\n",
    "\n",
    "By taking the instruct-tuned model as a base, we minimize the amount of information that our model should learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LoRA  (Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models) :\n",
    "LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models) is a popular and lightweight training technique that significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters. It works by inserting a smaller number of new weights into the model and only these are trained. This makes training with LoRA much faster, memory-efficient, and produces smaller model weights (a few hundred MBs), which are easier to store and share. \n",

    "This helps reduce drastically the memory requiered tot rain a model.\n"
